# Enigma Machine Simulation

This program simulates how the Enigma Machine encryption worked, written in C#. 

The machine's operation was explained in the following video:

## Overview

The Enigma Machine was a cipher device used during World War II to encrypt and decrypt secret messages. The simulation here replicates the key components of the machine, such as the plugboard, rotors, and reflector, and allows for encoding and decoding messages.

## Features

- **Rotor Configuration**: Simulates the rotor wiring and movement.
- **Plugboard**: Implements the plugboard to swap letters for added encryption.
- **Key Press Simulation**: Press keys on the virtual keyboard to see how the encryption is carried out.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The system updates in real-time as the rotors and plugboard configurations change.

## Installation
